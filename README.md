# Indoor-Localization-Using-6-axis-IMU-sensor-Python
In this repository, we developed an IMU-based indoor localization  system using the GY-521 module, which has both a gyroscope and an accelerometer. The first phase of  the project involved capturing raw data, and the second phase involved plotting and implementing three  filters: Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter, and Unscented Kalman Filter
